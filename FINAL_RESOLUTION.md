The detailed error message "Reminders are not enabled for this user. Please enable them in the settings." indicates that the application is working as intended, and the 400 Bad Request is due to the reminder settings not being enabled for your user.

To resolve this, please navigate to the reminder settings section in the frontend and enable reminders for your user. This is a configuration step within the application's UI, not a code bug that requires further modification.

I have addressed all the technical issues (React error, 404s, and 500s) and improved error reporting. The current issue is a functional configuration that needs to be handled through the application's user interface.
